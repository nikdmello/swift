commit d826e2228cffd28d8bf72a3569a1240244dc43a3

    Improved polling architecture with better reliability
    
    - Enhanced auto-withdrawal system with faster polling (5s intervals)
    - Added robust stream detection and fund withdrawal
    - Improved error handling and recovery mechanisms
    - Better resource management and cleanup
    - Hybrid approach attempted but fell back to polling due to RPC limitations
    
    Technical details:
    - Attempted event-driven approach but RPC filter issues prevented it
    - Base Sepolia RPC has aggressive filter cleanup causing 'filter not found' errors
    - Fell back to reliable polling approach with improved efficiency
    - System now polls every 5 seconds instead of 30 seconds
    
    Status: Fully functional with improved polling-based autonomous operation
